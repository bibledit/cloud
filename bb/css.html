Jesus therefore said to them again,
“Most certainly, I tell you, I am the sheep’s door.
All who came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep didn’t listen to them.
I am the door.
If anyone enters in by me, he will be saved, and will go in and go out, and will find pasture.
The thief only comes to steal, kill, and destroy.
I came that they may have life, and may have it abundantly.
I am the good shepherd.
The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.
He who is a hired hand, and not a shepherd, who doesn’t own the sheep,
sees the wolf coming, leaves the sheep, and flees.
The wolf snatches the sheep, and scatters them.
The hired hand flees because he is a hired hand, and doesn’t care for the sheep.
I am the good shepherd.
I know my own, and I’m known by my own;
even as the Father knows me, and I know the Father.
I lay down my life for the sheep.
I have other sheep, which are not of this fold. I must bring them also, and they will hear my voice.
They will become one flock with one shepherd.
Therefore the Father loves me, because I lay down my life, that I may take it again.
No one takes it away from me, but I lay it down by myself.
I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again.
I received this commandment from my Father.”
