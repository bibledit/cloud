"There are other notes selection mechanisms as well. See the relevant page "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you select notes that contain Any text, then searching for text in the "
"note is not done."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Searching for text can be done by selecting notes that contain specific "

"becomes visible. Search text should be entered there. Then the Save button "
"should be pressed. This is to save that search text. Or just pressing Enter "
"while the cursor is in that entry will do also."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When you search for, for example, 'house', then notes that contain the word "
"'house' will be selected. Notes that contain the word 'houses' (in plural) "
"would not be selected. To select this plural form, you can use wildcards. "
"Instead of entering 'house, enter 'house*' Notice the asterisk. This will "
"select notes that contains the word 'house' or 'houses."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can also enter two or more words to search for. The search routine will "
"then do its best to select these notes that contain some or all of these "
"words. Notes that contain all words are given first, and notes that contains "
"only one or a few of the words will be given later."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you select notes that refer to the current verse, and then also search "
"for some text, then only the notes that refer to the current verse would be "
"searched. It is important to be aware of this. At times one may search for "
"words or phrases, and get zero results, yet he is sure that there should be "
"some results. This would happen because the user does not search the whole "
"Bible, but only the current verse. The same applies to other selection "
"mechanisms. Therefore, when searching notes for text, you may want to set "
"all other selection mechanisms to Any."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There is more that can be said about searching notes. The wildcard operator "
"already has been mentioned. Here is a list of possible operators:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"By default, when no operator specified, the word is optional, but the result "
"that contain it will be rated higher."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A leading plus sign indicates that this word must be present in every result "
"returned."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A leading minus sign indicates that this word must not be present in any "
"result returned."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A leading tilde acts as a negation operator, causing the word's contribution "
"to the result relevance to be negative. It's useful for marking noise words. "
"A result that contains such a word will be rated lower than others, but will "
"not be excluded altogether, as it would be with the minus operator."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An asterisk is the wildcard operator. Unlike the other operators, it is "
"appended to the word, or fragment, not prepended. This means that if there "
"is a note with the word 'house', and you search for '*ouse', this note will "
"not be selected. Yes, this is unusual, but this is how the database search "
"works. To minimize the pain of this, measures have been taken that if you "
"type any part of the word, the expected result will still be found."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Double quotes at the beginning and end of a phrase, gives only the notes "
"that contain the complete phrase, as it was typed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Each note can be assigned to somebody. The person to whom the note is "
"assigned then knows that action should be taken on this note. Or the person "
"can be automatically emailed if the note gets changed."
msgstr ""

msgid "The Consultation Notes can partly be operated by email."
msgstr ""

"When you receive an email from Bibledit, and this email contains a "

"If you think that the Bible you translated is good and reliable, and you "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Compare an open Bible to the Greek minuscules: They were copied freely, and "
"they can now be found all over the place."
msgstr ""

msgid "Freely you received, freely give."

msgid ""
"Various church people regularly express a desire to have a more accurate "
"Bible than what they have now."
msgstr ""

msgid "The years pass by and the desire becomes stronger."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"They pray about the matter, discuss it, and decide to start the work on "

msgstr ""

msgid "The booklet is published by the Bible Society."

msgid "Over the years some people join the group, and others leave the group."

"The church now has a translation team consisting of four people who by the "

msgstr ""

msgid "Each of the four people bring in their own expertise."
msgstr ""

msgid "Two of them focus on the target language."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"They aim at using accurate, faithful, beautiful and contemporary language."
msgstr ""

msgid "One of them focuses on the original Greek and Hebrew."

msgid "He ensures that the translated text matches the originals."

msgstr ""

msgid "She aims at acceptance of the language by the future readers."

msgid "Many proof-readers contribute to the work."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The translation team regularly consults with language scholars and church "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Bible Society answers queries about how to translate difficult passages."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The team leader decides to not do this, but let the Bible Society be the "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The translator feels disappointed, because the Bible, now complete and "

msgstr ""

msgid "Not in paper form, not in digital form."
msgstr ""

msgid "It is enslaved, again."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Over the years the translator heard stories from others who had similar "
"experiences."
msgstr ""

msgid "It occurs to him that the current way of doing things is not right."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It leads to a situation where the Bible is not free to go where it is needed "
"most:"
msgstr ""

msgid "To the people."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The translator begins to see more clearly that Christians should have "
"freedom to publish Bibles or portions of it any time they wish to do so."
msgstr ""

msgid "The translator becomes the leader of the translation team."
msgstr ""

msgid "The team leader is acquainted with open licenses."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"He chooses the GNU Free Documentation License as an appropriate license for "
"the Bible."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"He is of the view that it is appropriate for the Word of God to be created "
"under an open license to allow it to have free course."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The GNU Free Documentation License allows noncommercial distribution of the "
"Bible by anyone who accepts the license."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"That is a good thing because this enables anyone to print the Bible and give "
"it to someone else."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The GNU Free Documentation License allows commercial distribution of the "
"Bible by any publisher who accepts the license."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is good, because it maximizes the distribution potential by allowing "
"sales of printed Bibles."
msgstr ""

msgid "It also harnesses the profit motive for distribution."
msgstr ""

msgid "It limits overcharging with competitive pressure on prices."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The GNU Free Documentation License allows to update the Bible, provided the "
"updated version is shared under the same license."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is a good thing because it allows legitimate updates, revisions, "
"adaptations with no hassle to the translators and no delay for getting "
"permission."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A disadvantage is that changes can be made by people who might not be "
"qualified or called to make changes, with possibly heretical results."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There is some fear that granting permission to make revisions would make it "
"easier for somebody to make heretical changes to the Bible."
msgstr ""

msgid "But copyright law is not about preventing this."
msgstr ""

msgid "If anyone wants to make those changes, he would still do it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There is no need for this fear, because it is God who protects His own work."
msgstr ""

msgid "He makes clear what is a good translation, and what is not."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If a Bible Society is so protective about a Bible, so as not to grant a "
"license to make revisions, then there is a bigger danger than that of heresy."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The bigger danger is that the copyright holder holds on to the Bible, or "
"disappears, or dies, or fails to be a good steward of it."
msgstr ""

msgid "Nobody would be allowed to improve or update the text."
msgstr ""

msgid "Trust God."
msgstr ""

msgid "He takes care of His Word."
msgstr ""

msgid "He deals with anyone who might abuse it."
msgstr ""

msgid "The Bible Society says:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We own copyright, not in any way to restrict distribution, but to preserve "
"the text."
msgstr ""

msgid "Protecting the text may at times restrict distribution."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For example, the Bible must be distributed by us, or under our supervision."
msgstr ""

msgid "We have made a big investment in the Bible."
msgstr ""

msgid "Nobody may improve it without our authority."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If anybody gives us details as to where the Bible can be improved, they can "
"improve it, but only when we agree."
msgstr ""

msgid "This Bible is our property."
msgstr ""

msgid "We share it."
msgstr ""

msgid "It is not entirely ours, so there is a shared property."
msgstr ""

msgid "The Free Documentation License is good in an ideal world."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"But the world is evil, so we need a license where we can protect the "
"integrity of the text."
msgstr ""

msgid "The proponent of the free Bible says:"
msgstr ""

msgid "A free license enables spreading the Word of God more quickly."
msgstr ""

msgid "The Bible Society has made such a reliable and good Bible."
msgstr ""

msgid "Is it not worthy of being spread as far and wide as possible?"
msgstr ""

msgid "A restrictive license confines the Word to one publisher, one channel."
msgstr ""

msgid "A free license opens up the Word to being spread by more channels."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the license is restrictive, it is not the bad people who are afraid of "
"illegally copying the Word of God, making changes, then publish it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"But it's the good people who would be worried to violate copyright law when "
"spreading the Word, thinking that God's blessing cannot be on something "
"illegal."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The free license does not aid bad people much, but it assists good people in "
"many ways."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A restrictive license does not stop heretics in any way, but it stops good "
"people from spreading the Word."
msgstr ""

msgid "The restrictive Bible Society says:"
msgstr ""

msgid "If you revise our Bible, we'll see you in court."
msgstr ""

msgid "The free and open Bible Society says:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you revise and spread our Bible, we thank God for opening another channel "

msgid ""
"All Bibledit editions, including Bibledit Cloud, enable Bible translation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"With a fast internet connection, it is usually easiest to translate straight "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When the internet connection is slow, or when it is off at times, it is "

msgstr ""

msgid "You can also use the keyboard to navigate."
msgstr ""

msgid "On touch screens you can swipe to navigate."
msgstr ""

msgid "The Navigator shows two arrows:"
msgstr ""

msgid "goes back in the navigation history."
msgstr ""

msgid "goes forward in the navigation history."
msgstr ""

msgid "There are also keyboard shortcuts for it."
msgstr ""

msgid "Some pages display one or more clickable passages."
msgstr ""

msgid "Clicking them updates the Passage Navigator."
msgstr ""

msgid "Scrum-based Translation"
msgstr ""

msgid "What is Scrum-based translation?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A translation team that works with Scrum frequently releases portions of "
"translated Scripture."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This makes it clear to involved parties where the translation project is "
"going."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It enables the translation team to make course corrections based on the "
"facts."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Burndown charts and the product backlog provide the product owner and others "
"with a permanent overview over the translation status and progress."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Scrum is an agile process that enables self-organizing translation teams to "
"deliver high translation output and accuracy in a short time."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Using iterative translation, it releases portions of translated Scripture "
"every iteration, say, every month."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"At the end of the every sprint, anyone can see the translated portion, and "
"decide whether to release it to the congregations and community for feedback "
"or continue to enhance it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The introduction and the following explanation just outlines the mechanics "
"of Scrum-based Translation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It does not make clear what difficulties and issues you will run into trying "
"to implement it."
msgstr ""

msgid "It only hints at the agile spirit that's required to make it work."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you're interested in implementing Scrum-based translation, do some "
"reading, watch videos, follow a course, find a mentor or coach."
msgstr ""

msgid "Product Owner"
msgstr ""

msgid "The Product Owner represents the stakeholders."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"He or she is the voice of the target audience, that is the Bible reader."
msgstr ""

msgid "He understands the requirements for the Bible."
msgstr ""

msgid "The Product Owner may also be a group of people in a committee."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"He is responsible for ensuring that the team delivers accuracy and "
"reliability to the Bible translation."
msgstr ""

msgid "He knows about accuracy and reliability."
msgstr ""

msgid "He defines items that focus on desired features."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"He makes decisions as to whether to implement footnotes or leave them out."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the same way, he defines other features, like headers, introductions, or "
"decides to leave them out."
msgstr ""

msgid "He decides about use or non-use of a dialect."
msgstr ""

msgid "He sets the priorities for the work to be done."
msgstr ""

msgid "He adds the items to the product backlog."
msgstr ""

msgid "Scrum teams should have one Product Owner."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Product Owner may be part of the Translation Team, but it is recommended "
"that his role not be combined with the role of Scrum Master."
msgstr ""

msgid "Release Planning"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The release planning shows which parts of the Bible will be translated and "
"delivered during which Sprint."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is convenient to define a Sprint in months, so that the release planning "
"mentions January, February, and so on."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is often helpful to stick the release planning to the wall so that "
"everybody can see the grand picture."
msgstr ""

msgid "The advantages of a release planning are:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"1. It gives the team a common vision about what needs to be achieved, and "
"when."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The product backlog is an ordered list of requirements that is maintained "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It consists of translation tasks, checking tasks, testing tasks, "

msgstr ""

msgid "The Product Owner prioritizes the items on this list."
msgstr ""

msgid "It is used to determine the work for the next sprints."
msgstr ""

msgid "Each item has an associated estimated time to complete."
msgstr ""

msgid "A sprint typically takes one month."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is where the translaton work (translate, review, approve, test) occurs."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Each member of the team translates independently and in a responsible manner."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In case a translator is sure of a required change, he enters it without "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If a translator thinks a proposed change needs discussion, he notifies his "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"All members of the translation team review the changes made by the team."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is to make sure that all changes are reviewed by all members, that no "

msgstr ""

msgid "The reviews take place every day."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This way of working is based on personal responsibility and mutual trust."

msgid "The sprint backlog is a list of tasks to be completed in a sprint."

msgid ""
"The tasks are created by breaking down the product backlog items during the "

msgid "Daily Scrum Meeting"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On each day of a sprint, the Bible translation team holds daily meetings."
msgstr ""

msgid "These meetings are called: Daily scrum meetings."
msgstr ""

msgid "The scrum meetings are held in the same place and at the same time."
msgstr ""

msgid "The meetings are typically held in front of Task Board."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The daily scrum meeting is best held in the morning, because it assists in "
"setting the context for the work of that day."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"During the meeting, all members stand, as this keeps the discussion short "
"and relevant."
msgstr ""

msgid "The scrum meeting is strictly time-boxed to 15 minutes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There is a difference between people who are 'committed' to the Bible "
"translation project, and those who are 'involved' in it."
msgstr ""

msgid "Scrum affords special status to those who are committed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Many teams enforce a rule in which only those who are committed are allowed "
"to talk during the daily scrum meeting."
msgstr ""

msgid "All team members are required to attend the scrum meetings."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Scrum Master and the and Product Owner (usually the Bible Translation "
"Manager) are committed team members."
msgstr ""

msgid "They are expected to attend and participate."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Anyone else, for example a Church leader, a Committee member, or a "
"Translator from another team, is allowed to attend but is there to listen "
"only."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This makes the daily scrum meeting an excellent way for a scrum team to "
"disseminate information."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you are interested in hearing the status of the project, attend that "
"day's meeting."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The scrum meeting is not the place for solving problems or resolving issues."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Issues that are raised are usually dealt with by one or two team members "
"immediately after the scrum."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"During the daily Scrum, each team member answers the following three "
"questions:"
msgstr ""

msgid "What did you do yesterday?"
msgstr ""

msgid "What are you going to do today?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Are there any impediments in your way?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Scrum Master asks each team member to answer these questions, the member "
"speaks, the Scrum Master thanks the member, and then goes to the next member."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"By focusing on what each person did yesterday and will do today, the team "
"gains an understanding of what work has been done and what work remains."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The daily scrum meeting is not a status update meeting in which the boss is "
"finding out about who is slow in his work."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Rather, it is a meeting in which team members make commitments to each other."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If a translator says: Today, I will prepare chapter 10 and 11 of Matthew, "
"everyone knows that in tomorrow's meeting, he will say whether or not he did "
"finish."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This has the wonderful effect of helping a team realize the significance of "
"these commitments, and that their commitments are to each other, and not to "
"anyone else."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Any impediments that are raised in the daily scrums become the Scrum "
"Master's responsibility to resolve as quickly as possible."
msgstr ""

msgid "Typical impediments are:"
msgstr ""

msgid "My ... broke and I need a new one today."
msgstr ""

msgid "I still haven't got the ... I requested a month ago."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"I'm struggling to understand ... and would like to discuss it with someone."
msgstr ""

msgid "The ... has asked me to work on something else for a few days."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In cases where the Scrum Master cannot remove these impediments directly "
"himself, he still takes responsibility for making sure someone on the team "
"does quickly resolve the issue."
msgstr ""

msgid "Every day a different person leads the daily scrum meeting."
msgstr ""

msgid "This gets the entire team involved."
msgstr ""

msgid "It opens up new channels for communication."
msgstr ""

msgid "It builds trust between the Translators and the Scrum Master."
msgstr ""

msgid "Team members can learn from one another's techniques."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Scrum Master ensures to set a good example for leading the daily scrum "
"meeting."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The scrum master uses the information from the meeting to update the "
"burndown chart illustrating progress."
msgstr ""

msgid "Side conversations are taken offline."
msgstr ""

msgid "Burn down chart"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A burn down chart is a graphical representation of work left to do versus "
"time."
msgstr ""

msgid "The outstanding work is on the vertical axis."
msgstr ""

msgid "The days of the sprint are on the horizontal axis."
msgstr ""

msgid "It is useful for predicting when all of the work will be completed."
msgstr ""

msgid "Sprint Review"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Product Owner looks through the sprint’s work and provides feedback."
msgstr ""

msgid "The Translators may demonstrate features."
msgstr ""

msgid "The Team owns up to deficiencies with the translation."
msgstr ""

msgid "This attitude helps to build trust with the Product Owner."
msgstr ""

msgid "Sprint Retrospective"
msgstr ""

msgid "The Team reviews what went well and what went poorly."
msgstr ""

msgid "They use retrospection techniques to find potential for improvement."
msgstr ""

msgid "They pick one or two areas to focus for improvement."
msgstr ""

msgid "When the Navigator is displayed, it focuses the name of the Bible book."
msgstr ""

msgid "Cancel any navigation or style operation."
msgstr ""

msgid "Navigate to the next verse."
msgstr ""

msgid "Navigate to the previous verse."
msgstr ""

msgid "Open the styles from the Bible editor."
msgstr ""

msgid "Search for words."
msgstr ""

msgid "Print."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Swiping right or left while displaying resources navigates to the previous "

msgstr ""

msgid "The same applies to the two verse-based Bible text editors."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Swiping right or left in the two chapter-based Bible text editors navigates "
"to the previous of next chapter."
msgstr ""

msgid "Bibledit can host many Bibles."
msgstr ""

msgid "Many users can create an account."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A translation team is formed by giving a group of users access to a Bible."
msgstr ""

msgid "A user may be granted read-only access to a Bible, or write access."
msgstr ""

msgid "The type of access also depends on the role of a user."

msgid "Extensions and plugins"
msgstr ""

msgid "Browser extensions and plugins may interfere with Bibledit."
msgstr ""

msgid "There was a case that the USFM editor didn't load the text."
msgstr ""

msgid "Disabling an extension in Chrome resolved it."
msgstr ""

msgid "Enable consultants to view the Bible in a workspace"
msgstr ""

msgid "Just add the desired Bible to the Resources through the link organizer."
msgstr ""

msgid "Then add the Resources to the workspace through URL resource/index."
msgstr ""

msgid "Backup"
msgstr ""

msgid "Bibledit does not do any backups of its own."
msgstr ""

msgid "Backup is very important."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The system administrator should have a reliable backup strategy in place."
msgstr ""

msgid "Bibledit uses SQLite for data storage."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If a database is backed up while SQLite is storing data in it, the database "
"may get malformed."
msgstr ""

msgid "Information."
msgstr ""

msgid "This applies to any database software, not just SQLite."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To accommodate backup, Bibledit does not access databases from 0:00 to 0:05 "
"at midnight."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If no users access Bibledit during that time, then there is no database "
"access at all."
msgstr ""

msgid "Syncing"

msgid "This may be resolved in two ways:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Manually run the two commands in the appropriate directory from a terminal."

msgstr ""

msgid "Import data into it."
msgstr ""

msgid "Choose the option to upload a file."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can upload 66 separate files, or you can put all the 66 files into one "

"Journal shows the progress."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Create a new stylesheet in menu Styles. Give it a name. The example calls it "
"'Ndebele'."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"All the data is now in Bibledit. Everthing is ready for export to "
"OpenDocument files."
msgstr ""

msgid "The OpenDocument files are used as a starting point for typesetting."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some of the word in the OpenDocument files are long. This results in too "
"much space between some words."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The words need to get hyphens so that part of the word goes on the next line."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"LibreOffice and Adobe InDesign have hyphenation algorithms for many "
"languages. That would solve the problem."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"But the programs do not have a hyphenation algorithms for all languages."
msgstr ""

msgid "Bibledit has a hyphenater that could assist."
msgstr ""

msgid "In Bibledit, go to menu Hyphenation."
msgstr ""

msgid "Enter the first set of characters, and the second set, and save it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Set the Bible where to take the data from. In this case it is 'Ndebele'."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Insert the soft hyphens according to the setting. It takes a while to "
"complete."
msgstr ""

msgid "The output Bible is called 'Ndebele-hyphenated'."
msgstr ""

msgid "Use this Bible from now on."
msgstr ""

msgid "Exporting to OpenDocument files"
msgstr ""

msgid "Make an initial export just to see how the text looks."
msgstr ""

msgid "In Bibledit, go to menu Exports."
msgstr ""

msgid "Add Bible 'Ndebele' to the ones that will be exported."
msgstr ""

msgid "Use stylesheet 'Ndebele'."
msgstr ""

msgid "Output the chapter number in drop caps. Switch that setting on."
msgstr ""

msgid "Set the page size. I use this: width: 138 mm; height: 210 mm."

msgstr ""

msgid "Switch 'Small caps' on."
msgstr ""

msgid "Do a new export, wait a while, and review the OpenDocument files again."

msgstr ""

msgid "Switch 'Superscript' off."
msgstr ""

msgid "Do a new export and review the OpenDocument files."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The text in the OpenDocument files has been divided into paragraphs. New "
"paragraphs start when appropriate in the context. This is how the USFM files "
"have been marked up."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The people who are going to read this Bible prefer each verse to start a new "
"paragraph."
msgstr ""

msgid "Go to the stylesheet, and choose the 'v' style."
msgstr ""

msgid "Set 'Restart paragraph' on."
msgstr ""

msgid "Export again."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Since each verse starts a new paragraph, there is no longer any need to "
"indent the first line of that paragraph."
msgstr ""

msgid "In the stylesheet, edit the 'p' style."
msgstr ""

msgid "Set the 'First line indent' to 0 mm."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some verses are short. Chapters that start with short verses no longer have "
"the chapter number in drop caps in LibreOffice."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is because this verse is all on one line, and thus there is no space "
"for drop caps, as these need two lines of text."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Setting the text in two columns in LibreOffice solves the problem. The drop "
"caps are back."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The letters of the Bible text are too big. This takes up a lot of space. The "

msgid "Typesetting guidelines"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The following needs consideration if the Bible includes more than one book."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Does the next book follow on the same page on which the previous book "
"finished, or do the books follow on from one another in a different way?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Whatever method is chosen, it needs to be applied consistently throughout "
"the Bible."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Line spacing should be consistent throughout and should be placed line on "
"line across all pages."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It means that all lines should line up with each other all the way down the "
"page and across all pages."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Then when the Bible is printed, the printed text will be back to back and "
"not show through from one side of the page to the other."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the typesetting software, this can be implemented by setting up a grid in "
"the document, and then aligning all text to this grid."
msgstr ""

msgid "The space after the verse numbers would be the same and consistent."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Bibledit exports the text to OpenDocument format using 'en spaces' after "
"each verse."
msgstr ""

msgid "This ensures a consistent width of the spaces after the verse numbers."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The verse numbers should be set closer to the text that follows than to the "
"preceding text."
msgstr ""

msgid "Many fonts have half spaces and hair spaces that can be used for this."
msgstr ""

msgid "Or set the kerning to a specific amount for the verse numbers."
msgstr ""

msgid "Superscript numerals could also be considered for verse numbers."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"They are less intrusive while at the same time just as readable and easily "
"found if they are not made too small."
msgstr ""

msgid "They should be larger than any note citations in the text."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The size of the superscript would be between 70 and 80 percent of the size "
"of the main text."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The alignment of the drop caps chapter numbers to the text beside it is to "
"be consistent."
msgstr ""

msgid "There should be some space between the numbers and the text."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Drop cap characters should not be too large and not rise too far above the "
"height of the other letters on the first line."
msgstr ""

msgid "The top of the highest letters should reach to about the same height."
msgstr ""

msgid "The drop cap characters in the body of the text should not be indented."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The chapter divisions would also benefit from some more space between them "
"and the text of the preceding chapter."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When there is no heading above a chapter, it may be visually better to start "
"the chapter number with a line space before it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The amount of space given to the Bible book headings should not be too much."
msgstr ""

msgid "But they can do with some space above and below them."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Subheadings should not appear squashed amongst the rest of the text and "
"would benefit from some space."
msgstr ""

msgid "Subheadings do not need to be set on the grid."
msgstr ""

msgid "They are much better set a little closer to the text that follows."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Subheadings are an addition and not Scripture, so it is appropriate to put "
"these in italics."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The space between the text and footnotes should not be too tight neither "
"unnecessarily large."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Keep the gap between the references in the footer and the main bock of text "
"as consistent as possible."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The footnotes and crossreferences should not have a large variation in how "
"far they finish from the foot of the page."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the crossreferences it is pleasing to have the chapter and verse number "
"kept together with the book name, especially as the small font on long lines "
"gives scope for this."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The columns should start at the same height and should be balanced at the "
"ends."
msgstr ""

msgid "The gap between the columns should be between 4 and 5 mm."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The centre line dividing the two columns should start about level or very "
"slightly above the top of the highest ascenders on the first line of text in "
"a column and finish about level with the bottom of the lowest descenders on "
"the bottom line."
msgstr ""

msgid "The centre line may also be omitted, as most modern Bibles do."
msgstr ""

msgid "The pages looks cleaner then."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Psalm headers need consistent spaces before and after and should be "
"positioned closer to the Psalm that follows than to the Psalm before."
msgstr ""

msgid "A 10 mm margin is okay for the top and bottom margins."
msgstr ""

msgid "A 12 mm margin is good for the outer margin."
msgstr ""

msgid "The inner margin needs slightly more, for example 14 mm."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For singable Psalms, readability would be helped by distinguishing the verse "
"numbers visually."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is helpful to distinguish the running head, perhaps by using a semi-bold "
"version of the same font."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"One way in which the number of pages in a volume could be reduced without "
"loss of readability would be to choose a font with slightly shorter "
"ascenders and descenders and then tighten the leading (line spacing) "
"slightly."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When producing PDF output, the text needs to be monochrome black, not black "
"consisting of three or four colours."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The last line of a verse or paragraph should not appear on its own at the "
"top of a column."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The typesetting software will have a setting for 'orphans' to control this."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An elegant way of avoiding orphans is to increase or decrease the tracking "
"of the text."
msgstr ""

msgid "This is the overall spacing of the letters in a paragraph or on a line."
msgstr ""

msgid "Avoid hyphenations in the headings."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Many book titles consist of a main title and a subtitle, like 'The gospel of "

msgid ""
"The number of hyphens used in a row should be few for enhanced readability."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Hyphenation should be set to the optimum result for the column width but "
