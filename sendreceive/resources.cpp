/*

 It used to take a very long time on low-power devices, like Android tablets and phones,
 to install a complete resource.
 
 Some measurements were done to see where the bottle neck was.
 
 1. Installed Staten Bible Resource on Mac via Cloud.
    Measured time: 13:46:57 to 14:08:38 = 20 minutes.
 
 2. Install Staten Bible Resource on Android via Cloud.
    Measured time: 15:10:52 to 17:06:57 = 116 minutes.
 
 Both devices were on the same network and connected to the same Cloud.

 Before doing the measurements, the Cloud's cache was filled with all data it had to fetch externally, so that external influences were excluded.
 
 There was a big difference between a Mac and an Android phone.
 Likely this was due to the difference in performance: 
 The Mac device is fast and powerful and the Android device is a low-power device.
 
 To resolve this, a new faster way to download resources was made available:
 1. The Cloud prepares the SQLite database with part of the resource.
 2. The Client downloads the entire database in one go.
