"It allows for more efficient usage of paper, and for more regular appearance "

msgid ""
"Hyphenation may not be so important when preparing a Bible for proofreading. "
"It is usually regarded important for production quality Bibles."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When preparing a Bible in LibreOffice, OpenOffice, AbiWord, en so on, the "

"If no suitable hyphenation algorithm can be used, perhaps Bibledit can "

"While Bibledit may be used for making any Bibles, there are some distinct "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Others will feel free to publish the open Bible. You don't need to do "
"everything yourself: Others will help spreading the Word of God."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It becomes easy to publish Bibles in a variety of formats by a variety of "
"people: on paper, phones, the Internet."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you think that the Bible you translated is good and reliable, and you "
"release it under an open license, it will rapidly spread over the Internet."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Compare an open Bible to the Greek minuscules: They were copied freely, and "
"they can now be found all over the place."
msgstr ""

msgid "Freely you received, freely give."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Various church people regularly express a desire to have a more accurate "
"Bible than what they have now."
msgstr ""

msgid "The years pass by and the desire becomes stronger."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"They pray about the matter, discuss it, and decide to start the work on "
"improving the Bible themselves, with the help of a booklet with directions."
msgstr ""

msgid "The booklet is published by the Bible Society."
msgstr ""

msgid "Over the years some people join the group, and others leave the group."

"The church now has a translation team consisting of four people who by the "
"grace of God work full time on the revision of the Bible."
msgstr ""

msgid "Each of the four people bring in their own expertise."

msgid "Two of them focus on the target language."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The team leader decides to not do this, but let the Bible Society be the "
"first to publish the Bible."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The translator feels disappointed, because the Bible, now complete and "
"accurate, is not free to go out to the people."
msgstr ""

msgid "Not in paper form, not in digital form."
msgstr ""

msgid "It is enslaved, again."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Over the years the translator heard stories from others who had similar "

msgstr ""

msgid "It occurs to him that the current way of doing things is not right."
msgstr ""

"It leads to a situation where the Bible is not free to go where it is needed "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The translator begins to see more clearly that Christians should have "
"freedom to publish Bibles or portions of it any time they wish to do so."
msgstr ""

msgid "The team leader is acquainted with open licenses."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"He chooses the GNU Free Documentation License as an appropriate license for "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"He is of the view that it is appropriate for the Word of God to be created "
"under an open license to allow it to have free course."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The GNU Free Documentation License allows noncommercial distribution of the "
"Bible by anyone who accepts the license."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"That is a good thing because this enables anyone to print the Bible and give "
"it to someone else."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The GNU Free Documentation License allows commercial distribution of the "
"Bible by any publisher who accepts the license."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is good, because it maximizes the distribution potential by allowing "
"sales of printed Bibles."
msgstr ""

msgid "It also harnesses the profit motive for distribution."
msgstr ""

msgid "It limits overcharging with competitive pressure on prices."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The GNU Free Documentation License allows to update the Bible, provided the "
"updated version is shared under the same license."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is a good thing because it allows legitimate updates, revisions, "
"adaptations with no hassle to the translators and no delay for getting "
"permission."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A disadvantage is that changes can be made by people who might not be "
"qualified or called to make changes, with possibly heretical results."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There is some fear that granting permission to make revisions would make it "
"easier for somebody to make heretical changes to the Bible."
msgstr ""

msgid "But copyright law is not about preventing this."
msgstr ""

msgid "If anyone wants to make those changes, he would still do it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There is no need for this fear, because it is God who protects His own work."
msgstr ""

msgid "He makes clear what is a good translation, and what is not."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If a Bible Society is so protective about a Bible, so as not to grant a "
"license to make revisions, then there is a bigger danger than that of heresy."
msgstr ""

msgid "The first thing that you can edit is how many notes will be selected."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you select notes that refer to any passage, then notes will be selected "

"notes that refer to the current verse, then only those notes will be "

"current verse, and that also have been edited today, are displayed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There are other notes selection mechanisms as well. See the relevant page "
"for all selection mechanisms. Things should be plain and there should be no "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you select notes that contain Any text, then searching for text in the "
"note is not done."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Searching for text can be done by selecting notes that contain specific "
"words or text. When you select this option, you will see that an entry "
"becomes visible. Search text should be entered there. Then the Save button "
"should be pressed. This is to save that search text. Or just pressing Enter "
"while the cursor is in that entry will do also."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When you search for, for example, 'house', then notes that contain the word "
"'house' will be selected. Notes that contain the word 'houses' (in plural) "
"would not be selected. To select this plural form, you can use wildcards. "
"Instead of entering 'house, enter 'house*' Notice the asterisk. This will "
"select notes that contains the word 'house' or 'houses."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can also enter two or more words to search for. The search routine will "
"then do its best to select these notes that contain some or all of these "
"words. Notes that contain all words are given first, and notes that contains "
"only one or a few of the words will be given later."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you select notes that refer to the current verse, and then also search "
"for some text, then only the notes that refer to the current verse would be "
"searched. It is important to be aware of this. At times one may search for "
"words or phrases, and get zero results, yet he is sure that there should be "
"some results. This would happen because the user does not search the whole "
"Bible, but only the current verse. The same applies to other selection "
"mechanisms. Therefore, when searching notes for text, you may want to set "
"all other selection mechanisms to Any."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There is more that can be said about searching notes. The wildcard operator "
"already has been mentioned. Here is a list of possible operators:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"By default, when no operator specified, the word is optional, but the result "
"that contain it will be rated higher."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A leading plus sign indicates that this word must be present in every result "
"returned."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A leading minus sign indicates that this word must not be present in any "
"result returned."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A leading tilde acts as a negation operator, causing the word's contribution "
"to the result relevance to be negative. It's useful for marking noise words. "
"A result that contains such a word will be rated lower than others, but will "
"not be excluded altogether, as it would be with the minus operator."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An asterisk is the wildcard operator. Unlike the other operators, it is "
"appended to the word, or fragment, not prepended. This means that if there "
"is a note with the word 'house', and you search for '*ouse', this note will "
"not be selected. Yes, this is unusual, but this is how the database search "
"works. To minimize the pain of this, measures have been taken that if you "
"type any part of the word, the expected result will still be found."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Double quotes at the beginning and end of a phrase, gives only the notes "
"that contain the complete phrase, as it was typed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Each note can be assigned to somebody. The person to whom the note is "
"assigned then knows that action should be taken on this note. Or the person "
"can be automatically emailed if the note gets changed."

msgid "Scrum-based Translation"
msgstr ""

msgid "What is Scrum-based translation?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A translation team that works with Scrum frequently releases portions of "
"translated Scripture."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This makes it clear to involved parties where the translation project is "
"going."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It enables the translation team to make course corrections based on the "
"facts."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Burndown charts and the product backlog provide the product owner and others "
"with a permanent overview over the translation status and progress."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Scrum is an agile process that enables self-organizing translation teams to "
"deliver high translation output and accuracy in a short time."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Using iterative translation, it releases portions of translated Scripture "
"every iteration, say, every month."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"At the end of the every sprint, anyone can see the translated portion, and "
"decide whether to release it to the congregations and community for feedback "
"or continue to enhance it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The introduction and the following explanation just outlines the mechanics "
"of Scrum-based Translation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It does not make clear what difficulties and issues you will run into trying "
"to implement it."
msgstr ""

msgid "It only hints at the agile spirit that's required to make it work."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you're interested in implementing Scrum-based translation, do some "
"reading, watch videos, follow a course, find a mentor or coach."
msgstr ""

msgid "Product Owner"
msgstr ""

msgid "The Product Owner represents the stakeholders."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"He or she is the voice of the target audience, that is the Bible reader."
msgstr ""

msgid "He understands the requirements for the Bible."
msgstr ""

msgid "The Product Owner may also be a group of people in a committee."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"He is responsible for ensuring that the team delivers accuracy and "
"reliability to the Bible translation."
msgstr ""

msgid "He knows about accuracy and reliability."
msgstr ""

msgid "He defines items that focus on desired features."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"He makes decisions as to whether to implement footnotes or leave them out."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the same way, he defines other features, like headers, introductions, or "
"decides to leave them out."
msgstr ""

msgid "He decides about use or non-use of a dialect."
msgstr ""

msgid "He sets the priorities for the work to be done."
msgstr ""

msgid "He adds the items to the product backlog."
msgstr ""

msgid "Scrum teams should have one Product Owner."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Product Owner may be part of the Translation Team, but it is recommended "
"that his role not be combined with the role of Scrum Master."
msgstr ""

msgid "Release Planning"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The release planning shows which parts of the Bible will be translated and "
"delivered during which Sprint."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is convenient to define a Sprint in months, so that the release planning "
"mentions January, February, and so on."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is often helpful to stick the release planning to the wall so that "
"everybody can see the grand picture."
msgstr ""

msgid "The advantages of a release planning are:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"1. It gives the team a common vision about what needs to be achieved, and "
"when."
msgstr ""

msgid "2. It guides the team to make decisions during detailed planning."
msgstr ""

msgid "3. It helps prioritize the actions."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"4. It resolves conflicts and guides the teams toward the right balance on "
"trade-offs."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Release each completed Bible book to the community and get their feedback."
msgstr ""

msgid "This implements the important principle of continual improvement."
msgstr ""

msgid "The release planning is a simple way of doing top-down planning."
msgstr ""

msgid "It is an estimate, simple and quick to do."
msgstr ""

msgid "It is based on the Product Backlog."
msgstr ""

msgid "Product Backlog"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The product backlog is an ordered list of requirements that is maintained "
"for the Bible translation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It consists of translation tasks, checking tasks, testing tasks, "
"comprehension tasks, whatever needs to be done to deliver a reliable "
"manuscript."
msgstr ""

msgid "The Product Owner prioritizes the items on this list."
msgstr ""

msgid "It is used to determine the work for the next sprints."
msgstr ""

msgid "Each item has an associated estimated time to complete."
msgstr ""

msgid "A sprint typically takes one month."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is where the translaton work (translate, review, approve, test) occurs."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Each member of the team translates independently and in a responsible manner."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In case a translator is sure of a required change, he enters it without "
"consulting others."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If a translator thinks a proposed change needs discussion, he notifies his "
"colleagues."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"All members of the translation team review the changes made by the team."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is to make sure that all changes are reviewed by all members, that no "
"mistakes occur."
msgstr ""

msgid "The reviews take place every day."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This way of working is based on personal responsibility and mutual trust."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It speeds up the translation procedure because there's more actual "
"translation work going on, and less discussions."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The newer members of the team learn from the more experienced ones through "
"the daily reviews."
msgstr ""

msgid "Bibledit has the concept of daily Change Notifications."
msgstr ""

msgid "A member can opt to receive the Change Notifications through email."
msgstr ""

msgid "This email can be viewed online also."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Or a member can opt to have the Change Notifications generated for him "
"online, and can review and approve them there."
msgstr ""

msgid "Sprint Planning Meeting"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"During this meeting the team selects the portions to translate, review and "
"test it believes it can commit to in a sprint."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The team breaks the portions down into tasks and provided estimates for "
"those tasks as to the time it takes to complete them."
msgstr ""

msgid "Sprint Backlog"
msgstr ""

msgid "The sprint backlog is a list of tasks to be completed in a sprint."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The tasks are created by breaking down the product backlog items during the "
"planning meeting."
msgstr ""

msgid "The tasks have estimates in hours or days associated with them."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For a team it is vitally important to have a clear goal to work towards."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Thus everybody is focused on the desired outcome, and keeps a good pace."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Without a clear goal, the team may still do a lot of things and work hard, "
"but the produced results may not have the desired value."
msgstr ""

msgid "Team"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The team consistes of the Bible translators, their assistants, and the "
"consultants."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The team organizes itself to carry out the work and deliver a reliable and "
"good Bible translation."
msgstr ""

msgid "The team is quick but does not hurry."
msgstr ""

msgid "The team goes fast, but always has an eye on translation quality."
msgstr ""

msgid "Scrum Master"
msgstr ""

msgid "The scrum master organizes the translation process."
msgstr ""

msgid "He or she keeps track of the progress of the translation team."
msgstr ""

msgid "He removes obstacles from the path of the team."
msgstr ""

msgid "Daily Scrum Meeting"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On each day of a sprint, the Bible translation team holds daily meetings."
msgstr ""

msgid "These meetings are called: Daily scrum meetings."
msgstr ""

msgid "The scrum meetings are held in the same place and at the same time."
msgstr ""

msgid "The meetings are typically held in front of Task Board."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The daily scrum meeting is best held in the morning, because it assists in "
"setting the context for the work of that day."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"During the meeting, all members stand, as this keeps the discussion short "
"and relevant."
msgstr ""

msgid "The scrum meeting is strictly time-boxed to 15 minutes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There is a difference between people who are 'committed' to the Bible "
"translation project, and those who are 'involved' in it."
msgstr ""

msgid "Scrum affords special status to those who are committed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Many teams enforce a rule in which only those who are committed are allowed "
"to talk during the daily scrum meeting."
msgstr ""

msgid "All team members are required to attend the scrum meetings."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Scrum Master and the and Product Owner (usually the Bible Translation "
"Manager) are committed team members."
msgstr ""

msgid "They are expected to attend and participate."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Anyone else, for example a Church leader, a Committee member, or a "
"Translator from another team, is allowed to attend but is there to listen "
"only."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This makes the daily scrum meeting an excellent way for a scrum team to "
"disseminate information."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you are interested in hearing the status of the project, attend that "
"day's meeting."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The scrum meeting is not the place for solving problems or resolving issues."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Issues that are raised are usually dealt with by one or two team members "
"immediately after the scrum."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"During the daily Scrum, each team member answers the following three "
"questions:"
msgstr ""

msgid "What did you do yesterday?"
msgstr ""

msgid "What are you going to do today?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Are there any impediments in your way?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Scrum Master asks each team member to answer these questions, the member "
"speaks, the Scrum Master thanks the member, and then goes to the next member."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"By focusing on what each person did yesterday and will do today, the team "
"gains an understanding of what work has been done and what work remains."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The daily scrum meeting is not a status update meeting in which the boss is "
"finding out about who is slow in his work."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Rather, it is a meeting in which team members make commitments to each other."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If a translator says: Today, I will prepare chapter 10 and 11 of Matthew, "
"everyone knows that in tomorrow's meeting, he will say whether or not he did "
"finish."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This has the wonderful effect of helping a team realize the significance of "
"these commitments, and that their commitments are to each other, and not to "
"anyone else."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Any impediments that are raised in the daily scrums become the Scrum "
"Master's responsibility to resolve as quickly as possible."
msgstr ""

msgid "Typical impediments are:"
msgstr ""

msgid "My ... broke and I need a new one today."
msgstr ""

msgid "I still haven't got the ... I requested a month ago."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"I'm struggling to understand ... and would like to discuss it with someone."
msgstr ""

msgid "The ... has asked me to work on something else for a few days."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In cases where the Scrum Master cannot remove these impediments directly "
"himself, he still takes responsibility for making sure someone on the team "
"does quickly resolve the issue."
msgstr ""

msgid "Every day a different person leads the daily scrum meeting."
msgstr ""

msgid "This gets the entire team involved."
msgstr ""

msgid "It opens up new channels for communication."
msgstr ""

msgid "It builds trust between the Translators and the Scrum Master."
msgstr ""

msgid "Team members can learn from one another's techniques."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Scrum Master ensures to set a good example for leading the daily scrum "
"meeting."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The scrum master uses the information from the meeting to update the "
"burndown chart illustrating progress."
msgstr ""

msgid "Side conversations are taken offline."
msgstr ""

msgid "Burn down chart"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A burn down chart is a graphical representation of work left to do versus "
"time."
msgstr ""

msgid "The outstanding work is on the vertical axis."
msgstr ""

msgid "The days of the sprint are on the horizontal axis."
msgstr ""

msgid "It is useful for predicting when all of the work will be completed."
msgstr ""

msgid "Sprint Review"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Product Owner looks through the sprint’s work and provides feedback."
msgstr ""

msgid "The Translators may demonstrate features."
msgstr ""

msgid "The Team owns up to deficiencies with the translation."
msgstr ""

msgid "This attitude helps to build trust with the Product Owner."
msgstr ""

msgid "Sprint Retrospective"
msgstr ""

msgid "The Team reviews what went well and what went poorly."
msgstr ""

msgid "They use retrospection techniques to find potential for improvement."
msgstr ""

msgid "They pick one or two areas to focus for improvement."
msgstr ""

msgid "Typesetting Bibles"
msgstr ""

msgid "Bibledit can assist with typesetting."
msgstr ""

msgid "But Bibledit is not designed for typesetting."
msgstr ""

msgid "It is for Bible editing."
msgstr ""

msgid "No more than that."
msgstr ""

msgid "Having said this, and despite this, let's press on."
msgstr ""

msgid "The Bible has been translated. It is time to publish it."
msgstr ""

msgid "This article assists with typesetting the Bible."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"At the end of all, you will have a PDF file with part of the Bible, or the "
"whole Bible, typeset, ready for publishing."
msgstr ""

msgid "Basic assumptions"
msgstr ""

msgid "The Bible is available in USFM code."
msgstr ""

msgid "The USFM code is clean and adheres to the standards."
msgstr ""

msgid "You have access to Bibledit."
msgstr ""

msgid "You have OpenOffice, LibreOffice or an equivalent."
msgstr ""

msgid "Importing the USFM files"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This section describes the steps to take to prepare the USFM code for export."
msgstr ""

msgid "Each Bible book is stored as one USFM file."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Create a new Bible in Bibledit. Give the Bible a name. The example calls it "
"'Ndebele'."
msgstr ""

msgid "Click the 'Ndebele' Bible."
msgstr ""

msgid "Import data into it."
msgstr ""

msgid "Choose the option to upload a file."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can upload 66 separate files, or you can put all the 66 files into one "
"zipped file, and then upload that zipped file. Import takes a while. The "
"Journal shows the progress."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Create a new stylesheet in menu Styles. Give it a name. The example calls it "
"'Ndebele'."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"All the data is now in Bibledit. Everthing is ready for export to "
"OpenDocument files."
msgstr ""

msgid "The OpenDocument files are used as a starting point for typesetting."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some of the word in the OpenDocument files are long. This results in too "
"much space between some words."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The words need to get hyphens so that part of the word goes on the next line."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"LibreOffice and Adobe InDesign and Scribus have hyphenation algorithms for "
"many languages. That would solve the problem."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"But the programs do not have a hyphenation algorithms for all languages."
msgstr ""

msgid "Bibledit has a hyphenater that could assist."
msgstr ""

msgid "In Bibledit, go to this menu:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Enter the first set of characters, and the second set, and save it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Set the Bible where to take the data from. In this case it is 'Ndebele'."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Insert the soft hyphens according to the setting. It takes a while to "
"complete."
msgstr ""

msgid "The output Bible is called 'Ndebele-hyphenated'."
msgstr ""

msgid "Use this Bible from now on."
msgstr ""

msgid "Exporting to OpenDocument files"
msgstr ""

msgid "Make an initial export just to see how the text looks."
msgstr ""

msgid "In Bibledit, go to menu Exports."
msgstr ""

msgid "Add Bible 'Ndebele' to the ones that will be exported."
msgstr ""

msgid "Use stylesheet 'Ndebele'."
msgstr ""

msgid "Output the chapter number in drop caps. Do not use frames."
msgstr ""

msgid "Set the page size. I use this: width: 138 mm; height: 210 mm."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Set the margins. I use this: 10 mm for top and bottom margins, 12 mm for the "
"outer margins, and 14 mm for the inner margins."
msgstr ""

msgid "The divine name will be underlined in the OpenDocument files."

msgstr ""

msgid "This can be changed in the stylesheet."

msgid "Go to menu Styles, and choose the 'Ndebele' stylesheet."
msgstr ""

msgid "Click the 'nd' style."
msgstr ""

msgid "Switch 'Underline' off."
msgstr ""

msgid "Switch 'Small caps' on."
msgstr ""

msgid "Do a new export, wait a while, and review the OpenDocument files again."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The verse numbers are in superscript. The verse numbers are small and "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The people who are going to read this Bible prefer each verse to start a new "

msgstr ""

msgid "Go to the stylesheet, and choose the 'v' style."
msgstr ""

msgid "Set 'Restart paragraph' on."
msgstr ""

msgid "Export again."

msgstr ""

msgid "In the stylesheet, edit the 'p' style."
msgstr ""

msgid "Set the 'First line indent' to 0 mm."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some verses are short. Chapters that start with short verses no longer have "
"the chapter number in drop caps in LibreOffice."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is because this verse is all on one line, and thus there is no space "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Setting the text in two columns in LibreOffice solves the problem. The drop "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The letters of the Bible text are too big. This takes up a lot of space. The "

msgid ""
"It means that all lines should line up with each other all the way down the "

msgid ""
"Then when the Bible is printed, the printed text will be back to back and "

msgid "The space after the verse numbers would be the same and consistent."

msgid "They are much better set a little closer to the text that follows."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the crossreferences it is pleasing to have the chapter and verse number "

"For singable Psalms, readability would be helped by distinguishing the verse "

msgid ""
"One way in which the number of pages in a volume could be reduced without "

msgid "This is the overall spacing of the letters in a paragraph or on a line."

"They can be filled by carefully adjusting tracking in one of the paragraphs."
